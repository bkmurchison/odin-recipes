        <li>2 beef shanks, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>

        <li>4 garlic cloves, crushed</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>For Serving</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 servings fresh or dried Japanese ramen noodles (not instant ramen)</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch cilantro leaves, leaves chopped</li>
        <li>lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Sauce Base</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For sauce base, first toast chilies: heat a dry griddle or skillet over medium heat. Toast gualjillo chilies and chiles de arbol, turning often, until fragrant and lightly browned, being careful not to burn them.  Place chilies in a bowl, cover them with boiling water, and soak until reconstituted - about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a large pan. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until soft - about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until they break down - about 5 minutes. Let the mixture cool.</li>
        <li>Place peppercorns, cloves, dried ginger, cumin seeds, thyme, marjoram, and oregano in a morter and grind into a fine mix.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine soaked chilies, 1/4 cup of the chile soaking liquid, onion-tomato mix, ground spices, chicken bouillion, and apple cider vinegar.  Blend until smooth.  Add a small amount of beef broth, if needed, for blending.  Taste sauce; season with salt.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Meet and Broth</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To cook meat, place chuck roast, beef shanks, and beef short ribs in a large pot and pour the sauce over it.  Add enough beef broth to cover meat by about 1-inch, then stir to combine.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then add cinnamon stick, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is tender and falling apart - about 2-1/2 hours.  Remove and discard short rib bones; skim fat from surface of broth using a spoon.  Reserve fat for another use, such as quesabirrias.  Taste broth; season with salt.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For Serving</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add ramen, and cook until tender - 7 to 20 minutes, or according to package instructions.  Drain; divide noodles into bowls.</li>
        <li>To assemble the dish, ladle birria and broth over ramen.  Top with chopped onion and cilantro.  Serve with lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
